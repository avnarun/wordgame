I am teaching spelling to my 4 year old and looking for a very simple spelling tool for long time.
Whatever I found so far are either bad quality, lots of distracting ads, or paid but unuseful apps.

Hence, thought to write on my own a very quick and basic web based tool, then out of curiousity searched on github and noticed few people have already done some work. So finally took @moof2k/wordgame as my baseline and started changing. Note- I am not sure if I am going to submit pull / merge changes to original as I plan to work on this on my own as per my kids need.

The game shows you a picture along with the corresponding word with one letter missing. You press the
key of the missing letter.
